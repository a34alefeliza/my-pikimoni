Here you can check some of the available interactions that you can have with your students. On top of there interactions you can build up your lesson. The contents that will show up are for demo purposes only. The idea is that you will upload into the platform your own contents (text, images, audio, video), or the contents of your linguistic center. Then you will organize them into collections, as in the papery teacher's book. Note that we are not proposing you a didactic, instead we are support you to use your didactic online.
